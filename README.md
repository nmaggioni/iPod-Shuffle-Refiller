# iPod-Shuffler
A mix of Bash and Python scripts to correctly copy and format music into an iPod Shuffle without the need to use iTunes. *OverVoice* is handled as well.

To use these scripts you need to install the Debian package `libttspico-utils` (needed for **pico2wave**), and the Python package `mutagen`.
If you are using Ubuntu you can issue the following commands to get them:

```
sudo apt-get install libttspico-utils python-pip
sudo pip install mutagen
```
